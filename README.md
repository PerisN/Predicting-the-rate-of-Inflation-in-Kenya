# Analyzing Inflation in Kenya with Linear Regression

The project delves into the complexities of inflation in Kenya from 2005 to March 2024. We'll leverage the power of linear regression to attempt to predict future movements.
## Hypothesis

- Develop a linear regression model to predict future 12-month inflation based on historical data.
- Faster economic growth (reflected by higher GDP) will be associated with higher inflation, due to increased demand for goods and services.
- A weaker Kenyan Shilling (represented by a higher average exchange rate) will contribute to higher inflation, as imports become more expensive.




## Instructions
- Gather the Data: We'll be using publicly available datasets from CBK on inflation, exchange rates and the GDP Growth

- Wrangle the Data: Get your hands dirty cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This might involve handling missing values, formatting dates, and creating new features if needed.

- Model Building: Build a linear regression model to predict 12-month inflation in Kenya.
    - Pro tip: Feel free to mix and match the data available to match the needs of your model!
    - Interpret the coefficients to understand the direction and strength of these relationships.
    - Evaluate the model's performance in explaining and potentially predicting inflation trends.



## Appendix

The project is designed to be a learning experience. Feel free to explore different approaches, test various hypotheses, and share your discoveries
